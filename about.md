Greetings! I am a computer science student pursuing a masters degree [**@Technical University of Munich**](https://www.tum.de/){:target="_blank"}. Nowadays, my work revolves around machine learning and computer vision. In particular, I research on learning based methods on 3d data. If you are seeking for a resume, find one [**here**](/assets/cv-moe-un.pdf){:target="_blank"}. I really like super-simple explanations, and in this blog I attempt to give some. Here, you are likely to encounter writings about:
- Data structures and algorithms
- Programming puzzles
- Machine learning
- Computer vision
