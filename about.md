Greetings! I am a computer science student pursuing a masters degree <a href="https://www.tum.de/" target="_blank" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'link-click', 'tum');"><b>@Technical University of Munich</b></a>. Nowadays, I am working on learning based methods on 3d data in computer vision. If you are seeking for a resume, find one <a href="/assets/cv-moe-un.pdf" target="_blank" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'link-click', 'resume');"><b>here.</b></a>

I really like super-simple explanations, and in this blog I attempt to give some. Here, you are likely to encounter writings about:
- Data structures and algorithms
- Programming puzzles
- Machine learning
- Computer vision
